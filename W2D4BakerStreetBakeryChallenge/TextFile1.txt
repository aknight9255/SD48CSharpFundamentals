Baker Street Bakery Challenge
A client, Mrs.Hudson, has asked us to make a console application for her bakery.
She is going to use it as a register system to enter customer orders.
Create a new console application. We are going to name this BakerStreetBakery.
We will need to create classes for both our Orders and Products.
The client has specified that she organizes her products based on type Bread, Cake, Pastry, Pies.
Each Order will need to have the associated Product, Customer Name, the ordered batch size, and the total order cost.
(Don't forget about your constructors)

We don't need to unit test the properties for this program.

Once you have created the class with your properties create a class for your repository name this class OrderRepository.
We need a method to add to an order to a list, get the list, remove from list, and print the list.

She also wants to charge an initial $100 per order and add an additional 
$500.01 for bread, $2000 for cake, $200.10 for pasteries, and $851.5 for pies. 
(This calculation should be in our repo)

Once you create your object class and repo, unit test the methods in your repository.
Do this in a new Unit Test Project name this BakerStreetBakery_Tests.

If you get the Repository built and tested, next we will want to build out a ProgramUI.
Create a method named Run(). 
Go back to the Program class and create an instance of ProgramUI in the static void main method and call the Run method. 

Ex: ProgramUI program = new ProgramUI();
    program.Run();

Write a user interface with a menu for the user which is our client to enter a order from a customer. 
They need to enter the name of the product such as Cinnamon Roll or Wedding Cake, the amount needed for the order. 
The cost will be calculated based on type (our method in the repository).
