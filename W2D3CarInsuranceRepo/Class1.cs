     * Car Insurance Repository Challenge
Komodo Insurance needs a program that will allow to easily track their customers. 
For now they only require some basics: a unique customer id number, last name, age, enrollment date, and number of years using Komodo Insurance.
Komodo wants to be able to store and manipulate our customers on a list.
KI also requires that any methods built are unit tested.

We also want to send a message to customers based on their years of subscribing. 
If they’ve been part of a plan for 1-5 years, we send them a thank you note. 
If they have been a customer for more than 5 years, we send them a note that says: “Thank you for being a Gold member.”   
Write unit tests to ensure your methods are working properly and use the repository pattern.*/
